# calculator
To apply what I learn in Javascript on objects and array to build a calculator.

How the calculator should work:
1) assign a final number to be evaluated everytime operator was key.
2) key number
3) key operator
4) If number was key, final number = 1st number (operator) 2nd number
Else operator was key, final number = 1st number (operator) 1st number
